# ** Foosball game Project **
By: Manar Taha, Hani Sbehi.

Me and my partner developed a foosball game utilizing an FPGA  (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The game includes an  automated player and a user-controlled player, with the gameplay  and scoring displayed on a screen.
## Features List: 
*	3 rods for each player, one rod with a goalkeeper and two rods with 3 players each.
*	Players respond to up and down pressure, lateral movement (standing and lying down).
*	 An automatic player as an opponent.
*	 The ball passes under a lying player, otherwise the player touches the ball with the option to strike it by pressing, with the force of the strike determined by the duration of the press.
*	 Keeping score on the screen.
*  Victory sounds.
*	A game timer that ends in a loss, victory, or a draw.
*	 Multiple difficulty levels that increase progressively, with an increase in the number of goalkeepers for the opponent at each stage.
